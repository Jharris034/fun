      <p>I was saying "Boo-urns." Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*.</p>

      <p>Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get. Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel.</p>
      <p>Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the&hellip;uh&hellip;what cures cancer? I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? Save me, Jeebus. I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>

      <p>Peter Griffin: I didn't give those porn magazines to the kids. The truth is Lois. Lois, Lois, Lois, Ah! Oh, crap. The truth is I love my wife Lois very much. I gave those porn mags to my son. I wanted to teach him about treating women as objects. If anything I don't deserve your respect.</p>

      <p>Stewie Griffin: Yes, I rather like this God fellow. He's very theatrical, you know, a pestilence here, a plague there. Omnipotence. Gotta get me some of that.
      Brian Griffin: [appalled by the students being stupid] Nobody can be this stupid, not even Peter when he took that blow to the head and thought he was Larry from Three's Company! Peter Griffin: [cutaway to Peter ending the kitchen dressed as 'Larry'] Jack, there's a hot-tub party across the street and we're invited! Brian Griffin: What are you talking about?</p>
      <p>[Brian is working as a guide dog and has taken a blind man to see "The Blair Witch Project"] Brian: Okay, they're - they're in the woods. The camera keeps on moving. Uh... I think they're looking for some witch or something; I don't know, I wasn't listening. Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. Something about a map. Nothing's happening. It's over. A lot of people in the audience look pissed.</p>

      <p>hy did you bring us here? Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? We don't have a brig. Actually, that's still true. We're also Santa Claus!</p>

      <p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be&hellip;</p>
      <p>File not found. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Who are those horrible orange men? Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates&hellip; PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
      <p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Ooh, name it after me! I'll get my kit!</p>
      <p>Okay, I like a challenge. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor</p>
